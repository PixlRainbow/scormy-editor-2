As we were required to produce SCORM 1.2 compliant courses which were compatible with Internet Explorer 11, we used BrowserStack to simulate the Internet Explorer 11 web browser. BrowserStack provided a convenient, centralized way to test compatibility when not all of our team members were using Windows. It was much faster than starting our own VMs whenever we needed to do testing.
